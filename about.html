However, if you are already struggling with cardiac problems, you should exercise extreme caution. Contraindications include, but are not limited to, diseases of the heart and circulatory system, including hypertension not regulated by medications.  When we plunge into the icy water, our heart overreacts. To help maintain a constant body temperature, it starts beating much faster. Our blood vessels narrow, other processes take place, which increases the secretion of adrenaline and increases systolic pressure. Cold also increases blood viscosity, and the risk of blood clots increases, which can lead to cerebral ischemia or arrhythmias.   </p>

Bathing in ice-cold water can rapidly increase blood pressure in this condition, which is very dangerous and can even lead to a heart attack. People suffering from Lyme disease or epilepsy should not be overwhelmed because these diseases affect the nervous system functioning.</p>

The key is prudence and gradual adaptation to lower temperatures. On the other hand, unskillful cold water swimming may cause exacerbation of cardiovascular diseases, higher risk of upper respiratory tract infections, frostbite, risk of drowning, and even hypothermia, which is dangerous to health and life. <br> Therefore, it is worth considering the decision before entering cold water on possible benefits that it may bring and potential threats. That being said, cold water swimming is an entirely new and interesting subject, and further research is required to understand the health benefits of its undertaking fully.
