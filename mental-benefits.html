He has over 20 Guinness World Records on his account. In his case, exposure to cold has significant positive effects on the body and mind.

Each person reacts differently to the cold, but you will find that most beginner ice swimmers experience tremendous wellbeing changes. It is worth trying this kind of therapy.</p></div>

It is hard to say clearly only the benefits of ice swimming in case of depression treatment. Many scientists agree that this type of treatment should take place on many levels. Taking medication may be necessary, but certainly, a person's feelings and attitudes play a huge role. New experiences of changing the environment and swimming in a group can play a significant role in treating depression. Any exercise is good for the body. Open water swimming in a group of friends or other community helps create achievements and make sense of life. Positive experiences from such activity make it easier to cope with problems and give a chance for treatment.</p></div>

This is because if we voluntarily do exercise such as swimming, our body recognizes it as a good effect. By repeating activities that are pleasant for the body, we make it easier for the body to regularly release the dopamine it needs. Cortisol release can be increased in short term. Cortisol increased from 99 ng/ml to 133 ng/ml in the untrained, and from 101 ng/ml to 137 ng/ml (p < 0.05) in the cold-trained persons within 30 minutes after cold water immersion, and decreased thereafter (p < 0.01) </p></div>
